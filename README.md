# The bayes_beat package

This file describes how to use the bayes-beat tracker class. The model is based on a paper originally published by Whiteley et al. in 2006 [1]. The model was adapted to audio data by Krebs et al. 2013 [2].

The bayes-beat class is best explored by looking at the examples folder. So far, there are four examples present:

1. Compute beats using a pretrained HMM model
2. Compute beats using a pretrained PF model
3. Learn the HMM observation model parameters from training data

If you want to quickly apply the beat tracker to some audio input, have a look at the `./bin` folder where you will find several beat trackers that use the *bayes_beat* base class.

Installation:
-------------

To use the much faster viterbi MEX-file, you have to build it first:

1. Within the MATLAB gui, go to the folder `./@HMM`.  
2. Then, execute `mex viterbi.cpp`.
