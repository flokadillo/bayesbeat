This file describes how to use the bayes-beat tracker class. The model is based on a paper originally published by Whiteley et al. in 2006 [1]. The model was adapted to audio data by Krebs et al. 2013 [2].

The bayes-beat class is best explored by looking at the examples folder. So far, there are four examples present:

1. Compute beats using a pretrained HMM model
2. Compute beats using a pretrained PF model
3. Learn the HMM observation model parameters from training data
4. Learn the PF observation model parameters from training data
